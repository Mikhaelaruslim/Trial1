       HEAD & METADATA LAB — STUDENT TEMPLATE (20‑minute Step 1)
       Step 1 is the ONLY required task and is designed to take ~20 minutes.
       Step 2 is for early finishers; Step 3 is for instant masters/hobbyists.
       ===================================================== -->


     <!-- =========================
      STEP 1 (MANDATORY): Metadata
           Scenario: Imagine you are making a simple homepage for a school club, a personal portfolio, or a favorite hobby. Choose one of these (or invent your own simple purpose) and keep it in mind as you complete the steps below. Your metadata will be the first impression for visitors and search engines—think about what would make someone want to visit or learn more about your page.                Goal: Add essential head metadata and practice crafting QUALITY text that fits your chosen scenario.
          Do each sub‑step in order.
           ========================= -->
     <!--Someone might want to visit and learn more about the page if there is something interesting that peaks their interest. Keeping it brief is also important so that people might not feel bored when reading it, but becomes curious with the information given.-->


     <!-- 1.1 — Encoding
       Consider: What does "charset" mean in the context of a web page? Why might "utf-8" be the default? What could happen if you use a different value? Can you find and list another possible value? After experimenting, what do you notice?
       -->
       <!-- It specifies the character encoding to the HTML document. Meta charset is mostly used since it supports almost every character in every language, it is universally used. Other possible values are ISO-8859-1, Shift_JIS, and Windoes-1252. If we use other values, it is possible t hat some characters might not be dispplayed properly.-->



     <!-- 1.2 — Title ideation (brainstorm 3)
       Reflect: Why does the title matter for a web page? Where does it appear, and who sees it? How could a poorly chosen title affect your site? Try to come up with three different titles and consider their impact. What makes a title effective?
       (Write your three ideas as comments below, then choose one.)
       -->
       <!-- The title matters for a webpage since it gives the first impression for the readers and it tells the search engine what the page is about. It appears on browsers, search engine results, social media previews, etc. A poorly chosen title might affect your site
        since it gives an impression that it has nothing inormation and is boring. A title that is effective must be short, match the content, and not too general. Three titles are Get to Know My Life, My Personal Portofolio, and Curiousity Answered.-->

     <!-- 1.3 — Choose your best title
       After considering your options, select the title you think is best, write it down below and explain (in a comment) why you chose it. What makes it stand out?
  -->
     <!--I chose Get To Know My Life since it is not boring but also specifies about what is inside the website.-->

     <!-- 1.4 — Description drafting (write 2 drafts)
       Think: Who uses the meta description, and how does it affect how your site appears in search results or on social media? What makes a description helpful or appealing? Write two different drafts, then reflect on which is more effective and why. Try to find an example of a meta description from a real website.
  -->
       <!--Meta description is used by programmers, search engines, social media, and even visitors. It affects the amount of visitation and clicks on the web. A description might be helpful if it covers the whole content concisely.
        Welcome. Here, you can learn about my life and portofolio. There will be detailed explanations and funfacts of myself.
        Hi. Its nice to meet you. Come and learn my about my life, achievements, funfacts, and even life story here.-->


     <!-- After choosing your best description, add it as a meta tag. In a comment, explain your reasoning. -->
      <!--I chose it because it tells me more detailedly than the first one.-->


     <!-- 1.5 — Verify & Connect
       Check your work in the browser and view the page source. What do you notice about how your changes appear? Why do you think these metadata elements matter for real websites? Write a brief reflection (as a comment or in a separate document) on how these details could affect a site's success or user experience.
  -->
       <!---It gives more information rather than just a link. These metadata elements matter to give information briefly and make sure about the content. It also improves users experience and is a bridge between the website and search engine.-->

     <!-- (Optional nicety for accessibility/viewports; not required in this lesson)
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  -->

     <!-- =========================
       STEP 2 (challenge): External CSS
       Task: Link a stylesheet and make the background obviously different.
       1) Open student_styles.css
       2) Change the body background to any visible color
       3) Link a stylesheet below
       ========================= -->
     <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="baseline.css"> -->
     <!-- Link student_styles.css here -->

     <!-- =========================
       STEP 3 (challenge): Favicon
       Task: Add an icon so your tab shows a tiny picture.
       Options:
       • Local file: <link rel="icon" href="favicon.png">
       • OR SVG data‑URI (encode # as %23 and % as %25):
       Tip: Do a HARD reload (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R). Browsers cache favicons.
       ========================= -->
